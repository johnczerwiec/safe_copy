# Note - UIDs should be unique to one user in this file. i.e. an adm_user can't have the same uid as a *different* username in the sftp_users group
# but a user should have the same uid if they're in multiple groups - e.g. jmcmillan using 1234 in adm_users should also be jmcmillan/1234 in sftp_users
